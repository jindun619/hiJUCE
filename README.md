# hiJUCE

hiJUCE is a project aimed at developing a guitar effect plugin, with a focus on creating unique and dynamic sound effects for electric guitars. Currently, the project is in the **UI development and learning phase**, and I have successfully implemented **sound distortion using soft-clipping** as a starting point. This project is built using **JUCE**, a powerful C++ framework for audio applications.

## 🎯 Final Goal

- Develop a fully functional electric guitar effect plugin.

## 🛠️ Current Progress

- **UI Development**: Learning and experimenting with JUCE's UI components.
- **Sound Distortion**: Implemented **soft-clipping** to create sound distortion effects.

## 📚 Tech Stack

- **JUCE Framework**: A C++ library for developing cross-platform audio applications.
- **C++**: Core programming language for audio processing and plugin logic.

## 💡 Features (So Far)

- **Soft-Clipping**: A basic sound distortion effect achieved through soft-clipping algorithms.

## 🔧 What's Next?

- Continue learning and implementing more advanced audio processing techniques.
- Develop a user-friendly and visually appealing UI for the plugin.
- Add more effects such as reverb, delay, and modulation.

## Key Learnings

- Gained foundational knowledge of JUCE framework for audio plugin development.
- Implemented soft-clipping for sound distortion.
- Started exploring UI development for audio plugins.
